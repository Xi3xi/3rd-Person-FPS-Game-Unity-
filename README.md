## Evaluation Plan

### Objective

The objective of this evaluation plan is to assess the effectiveness, playability, and overall user experience of Campus of Undead. This evaluation aims to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement to enhance the game before its final release.

### Evaluation techniques

We decided to opt for two different types of evaluation method to gather and receive feedbacks from different perspectives, covering as many aspects as possible. The two evaluation methods are cooperative evaluation for observational evaluation method and questionnaires for query-based evaluation. In terms of data analysis, we decided to analyse the cooperative evaluation data based on the participants' gaming experience or gamer level while analyse by gaming elements for the questionnaire result, to provide two distinct perspective for our evaluation.

#### Cooperative Evaluation

Conduct cooperative evaluation sessions with evaluation participants to observe their gameplay experience, gather feedback, and identify areas for improvement. Evaluation participants will be tasked to try to complete the game and win. We chose to use cooperative evaluation sessions as our observational evaluation technique since cooperative evaluation sessions allow us to help evaluation participants so that they do not hit a brick wall while trying to complete the game. However, there is a downside to cooperative evaluation sessions, which we must take into account. That is, we could "overhelp" the evaluation participants and so hide problems with the game.

#### Questionnaires

Evaluation participants will be asked to complete an online questionnaire to collect quantitative feedback regarding the game. We chose to use questionnaires as our querying evaluation technique instead of interviews since we are short on time and interviews are very time-consuming to analyse. The questionnaires will consist of closed questions, which is appropriate for collecting quantitative feedback regarding the game. The downside of using questionnaires as our querying evaluation technique is that there is little depth in responses, which is completely fine since we are only collecting quantitative feedback regarding the game.

### Participants

Our evaluation will cover a diverse audience encompassing both university students and academic staff members who are sure to enjoy the university-survival-horror theme. This inclusive demographic ranges widely in their coding expertise and gaming experience, ensuring a broad spectrum of perspectives. To ensure an accurate representation of our diverse audience, we will engage participants from various departments, including computing, commerce, and design, within and outside the University of Melbourne.

This diverse pool of participants, comprising both students and academic staff from different backgrounds, guarantees a more well-rounded evaluation process. It enables us to gather feedback from individuals with varying levels of coding knowledge and gaming skills, facilitating a more complete understanding of the game's strengths and areas for improvement.

### Data Collection

During our cooperative evaluation sessions, we will capturing qualitative observations from the interactions between participants and the game environment. These qualitative notes will serve as a rich source of insight, detailing the player experiences, frustrations, and moments of engagement. To facilitate this, we will  document our key observations in Confluence and analyze these qualitative observations later. Through this approach, we aim to uncover the underlying emotions, player behaviors, and challenges faced during gameplay, enabling a deeper understanding of the player's perspective.

Simultaneously, for the online component of our query-based evaluation process, we will utilise Google Forms, a user-friendly survey tool. The questionnaire will be crafted to gather quantitative data, providing structured responses to specific aspects of the game elements. The questions will be thoughtfully designed in the format of a linear scale ranging from 1 to 5. This format allows participants to rate their experiences, opinions, and preferences on a standardised scale, providing a clear and measurable indication of their satisfaction levels.

Google Forms: <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ra56tH51c8UmbpFKkSxLHqZu7B9IqPD2JyPaLRB7RMA/edit?ts=6527671b>

### Data Analysis

For the cooperative evaluation method, data analysis will be done by analysing the cooperative evaluation sessions' qualitative observations and quantitative responses according the participants' self-reporting gaming experience or gamer level. We will collate qualitative observations and quantitative responses and identify common patterns, recurring issues, and feedback within the same gamer level group.

For the questionnaire evaluation method, the questionnaire's quantitative responses will be grouped and analysed separately according to the pre-determined game's elements like UI and controls. We will compile all quantitative responses collected from the surveys and identify common patterns and optional qualitative feeedback from the participants within the same game element.

After analysing all the gathered data for both evaluation methods, we will summarise the findings into key findings, key insights, and issues to address. The game will be changed to solve the issues present in the evaluation.

## Evaluation Report

### Game Evaluation Questionnaire

Google Forms: <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ra56tH51c8UmbpFKkSxLHqZu7B9IqPD2JyPaLRB7RMA/edit?ts=6527671b>

#### 1. Questionnaire Evaluation üìë

The game evaluation questionnaire, designed for "Campus of the Undead" has been administered via Google Forms to gauge user experience and feedback. The objective of this section is to critically analyse the design, structure, and user experience of the feedback form.<br>

**Advantages**‚≠ê:  

- The questionnaire is segmented into distinct sections like game control, UI, and sound effects, offering respondents a clear path to articulate their experiences and feedback. <br>
- The use of a 5-point Likert scale simplifies data interpretation, making it easier to discern satisfaction trends and pinpoint areas needing improvement. <br>
- The diverse array of questions guarantees that feedback touches on multiple facets of the game, ensuring a comprehensive review process.<br>
- The inclusion of an open-ended question at the end facilitates deeper, more personalized user insights, capturing feedback beyond the scope of predefined questions.<br>
- The familiar design of Google Forms makes it user-friendly, promoting better respondent engagement.<br>
- Google Forms' capabilities of instant data aggregation and visualization speed up the analysis, aiding in quicker, feedback-informed decision-making.<br>

**Improvements**üõ†Ô∏è:

- Restricting feedback to preset questions might limit the depth of insights, overlooking some subtle yet crucial user perspectives.<br>
- The 1-5 rating scale might lead to a central tendency bias, with responses gravitating towards neutral scores.<br>
- Google Forms lacks the feature for direct screenshot or video clip uploads, a significant drawback for capturing visual feedback in a game setting.<br>
- Google Forms' limited customization options might not resonate with the game's aesthetic theme, creating a potential disconnect in the user's feedback experience.<br>
- Some questions may appear overlapping or vague. Ensuring each question is distinct and clear can uplift the feedback's quality.<br>
- A lengthy form could discourage comprehensive responses. Implementing navigational aids or progress indicators might improve user engagement throughout the feedback process.<br>
  
#### 2. Questionnaire Feedback Analysis üìà

- **Part I. Game Control:** <br>
Participants largely praised the game controls and aiming, with many awarding scores of 4 or 5 out of 5. Given this positive sentiment, significant alterations seem unnecessary. However, to ensure broad appeal, additional testing involving a more varied group of players could verify the controls' widespread intuitiveness.

 <div align="center"><img src="Images/gdd/evalution/1.png" width="700"/></div>

***All figures in this section illustrates the analysis of our questionnaire results. On the x-axis, we have the various questions from each section, with scores ranging from 1 to 5 representing the responses. The y-axis denotes the percentage of testers who awarded the respective scores.**
<br>

- **Part II. UI:** <br>
Feedback about the menu's usability and layout was varied, indicating some players faced challenges. While the display of character stats, notably health and ammo, garnered a generally positive response, there was notable difficulty in identifying collectible items and comprehending the inventory. However, interactions and comprehension related to NPCs received commendations. The skill tree's clarity and the process of skill equipping evoked mixed feelings among players.

<div align="center"><img src="Images/gdd/evalution/2.png" width="700"/></div>
<br>

- **Part III. Sound Effects:** <br>
Sound design, particularly for zombies and weapons, resonated well with most testers, creating an immersive experience. There was no pervasive feeling of sound clutter, with players comfortably discerning various audio cues. A noteworthy portion of feedback highlighted a desire for ambient music, especially during explorative phases and boss encounters.

<div align="center"><img src="Images/gdd/evalution/3.png" width="700"/></div>
<br>

- **Open Comments:** <br>
Challenges in locating skill-unlocking items emerged as a prominent issue. Suggestions leaned towards enhanced visual indicators for collectible objects, feedback for zombie hits, and zombie health bars. The expansive map size was a recurrent concern, with players feeling the pressure of fulfilling objectives in the stipulated timeframe. There's also a collective call for sharper game objectives and more intuitive default controls.

### Cooperative Evaluation

#### 1. Cooperative Evaluation üìë

On top of the questionnaires, in order to exchange ideas and thoughts with the testers, we opt ofr the cooperative evaluation method to assess the prototype of our game "Campus of the Undead". For the cooperative evaluation, we analyse our results by the participants' gaming experience or gamer level to provide another perspective for our evaluation. Our objective was to gather more diverse feedback from players, gamers, developers and designers with different gaming experience to enhance the overall gaming experience. By conducting 6 of playtesting sessions with our participants, we aimed to identify gameplay issues, bugs, and design inconsistencies.<br>

**Advantages**‚≠ê:  

- Cooperative evaluation incorporates feedback from various stakeholders, including players, developers, designers, and experts and different level of gaming experience. This diverse range of perspectives provides comprehensive insights into the game's strengths and weaknesses. <br>
- Participants can identify issues related to gameplay, mechanics, graphics, and overall user experience. This detailed feedback allows us to make targeted improvements.<br>
- During playtesting sessions, we can observe players' reactions and challenges in real-time. This observation enables immediate adjustments and fine-tuning of the game elements. <br>
- Cooperative evaluation allows for iterative development, where feedback is implemented, and the game is re-evaluated. This iterative process leads to continuous enhancement, resulting in a polished final product. <br>
- By involving players directly in the evaluation process, we can create games tailored to user preferences, increasing the likelihood of the game being well-received by the target audience.<br>
  
**Improvements**üõ†Ô∏è:

- Organizing playtesting sessions with the participants requires time, effort, and resources, limiting the number of participants we can include in our evaluation phase <br>
- The number of participants in cooperative evaluation sessions is limited to 6 due to logistical constraints. A small sample size might not accurately represent the diverse player base, leading to skewed results.<br>
- Evaluations are subjective and dependent on individual perceptions. What one player finds enjoyable, another might dislike. Balancing conflicting feedback can be challenging for us.<br>
- Participants' feedback might be influenced by personal preferences, gaming backgrounds, and cultural differences. During our analysis, we often found conflicting feedbacks from players with different gaming experience.<br>

## Shaders and Special Effects

### Force Field Shader

[ForceField.shader](Assets/Shaders/ForceFieldShader/ForceField.shader)
<br/><br/>
The shader creates the force field effect using the fresnel effect.

#### Fresnel Effect

The fresnel effect is the observation that the amount of reflectance seen on a surface depends on the viewing angle.

<div align="center"">
  <img src="Images/readme/force-field-shader/force-field-shader-1.png" width="500"/>
  <p align="center">Fresnel effect on flat surfaces. From https://www.dorian-iten.com/fresnel/.</p>
</div>

<div align="center"">

  <p align="center">Fresnel effect in real life. From https://www.dorian-iten.com/fresnel/.</p>
</div>

On curved surfaces, the angle of incidence gets shallower towards the edges. On a sphere, the fresnel effect leads to the reflections being the strongest on the edges.

<div align="center">
  <img src="Images/readme/force-field-shader/force-field-shader-4.png" width="500"/>
  <p align="center">Fresnel effect on curved sufaces. From https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Principle-of-the-Fresnel-effect-the-amount-of-reflection-on-a-reflective-surface-depends_fig3_319178578.</p>
</div>

#### Fresnel Shader

To create the force field effect, a fresnel shader is applied on a sphere. But instead of varying the amount of surface reflectance based on the angle of incidence, the shader varies the surface glow based on the angle of incidence. The fresnel shader leads to the surface glow being the strongest on the edges.

<div align="center">
  <img src="Images/readme/force-field-shader/force-field-shader-5.png" width="500"/>
  <p align="center">Force field effect.</p>
</div>

Firstly, the shader implements a vertex shader to transform each vertex from object space to clip space and calculate the fresnel reflection strength for each vertex based on the angle of incidence between the vertex and the camera.

Then, the shader implements a fragment shader, which uses the fresnel reflection strength for each vertex as the corresponding fragment's alpha value. The alpha value determines the fragment's glow. The RGB colour for the fragment is calculated based on the linear interpolation between the glow colour shader property and edge colour shader property, controlled by the fragment's alpha value. Finally, the RBGA colour for the fragment is constructed by combining the calculated RGB colour for the fragment and the fragment's alpha value.

In summary, the vertex shader calculates the vertices fresnel reflection strength. Then, the fragment shader uses the vertices calculated fresnel reflection strength to create a glow effect.

</div>

### Portal Shader

[WaterShader.shader](Assets/Shaders/WaterShader/WaterShader.shader)

This shader is a modified version of water shader, from tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcGT_jji5xQ>
<div align="center">
  <img src="Images/readme/portal-shader/portal.gif" width="500"/>
  <p align="center">Portal effect shader.</p>
</div>

#### How it works

<div>
The portal effect is achieved by modifying a water shader. First, we create a plane of water by randomly moving its vertices up and down to simulate waves using a noise texture. Next, we apply the water texture to the normal texture. Finally, we calculate camera depth, transform it to a variable between 0-1, and apply it to the texture's alpha to further mimic the effect of the water's opacity increasing with its depth.

To turn the water shader into a portal shader, we use a different texture which better simulates the effect of a twisted portal space, then we set the alpha to be always maximum to make the effect more obvious.

Noted that the waves can only be seen when there is a light source, to make the effect more obvious, we further attached two point lights beside the portal.
</div>

### Blood Particle System

[Blood.prefab](Assets/Prefabs/Effects/Blood.prefab)
#### How it works

<div align="center">
  <img src="Images/readme/blood-effect/blood1.gif" width="500"/>
  <p align="center">Blood Effect.</p>
</div>
The particle system‚Äôs randomness and the ability to spray particles inspire us to use it to implement blood splashes when a zombie is hit. We use a single drop of blood as a single particle and generate a blood splash by randomly emitting blood particles from one point.

#### Base texture

<div align="center">
  <img src="Images/readme/blood-effect/blood.png" width="100"/>
  <p align="center">Base texture.</p>
</div>
The base texture of blood particle is a hand-drawn blood splash. We replace the default soft edge dot with this texture to mimic blood splashes.

#### Duration, Speed and looping

<div align="center">
  <img src="Images/readme/blood-effect/blood2.gif" width="500"/>
  <p align="center">Blood effect particles.</p>
</div>

The duration is rather short and the speed is fast to mimic the effect of hitting by a bullet, and it is not looping because we want it to play only once per hit.
Size over lifetime

Although it is not obvious because of the short duration, we set the size over the lifetime to be decreasing to mimic how blood drops become smaller when they are further away from the hit point.
</div>

#### Randomness

We use auto-random seed to generate different particle patterns on each play. We also set the arc shape to random so that we could get blood drops emitting in different directions
<div align="center">
<img src="Images/readme/blood-effect/attribute.png" width="500"/>
  <p align="center">Auto Random Seed is active.</p>
<img src="Images/readme/blood-effect/shape.png" width="500"/>
  <p align="center">Random arc is active.</p>
</div>
